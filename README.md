# iECDIS

iECDIS is supposed to be a simple ECDIS software for Mac OS X, following the basic requirements for navigation in ECDIS software, as defined by the Maritime Organizations. It must be capable of opening maps in both Raster and Vector formats. To begin with the focus will be to display **BSB/KAP** and unencrypted **ENC** maps, as well as online maps supplied by [OpenSeaMap](https://maps.openseamap.org/), and receive position over [NMEA0183](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) (USB, Serial ports, etc) and [NMEA2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_2000) (ethernet, USB, Serial ports, etc). Primary focus for NMEA will be to support GPS positioning, but more devices will be added after a working version have been achieved.
