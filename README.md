# iECDIS

iECDIS is supposed to be a simple ECDIS software for Mac OS X, following the basic requirements for navigation in ECDIS software, as defined by the Maritime Organizations. It must be capable of opening maps in both Raster and Vector formats. To begin with the focus will be to display **BSB/KAP** and unencrypted **ENC** maps, as well as online maps supplied by [OpenSeaMap](http://map.openseamap.org/map/)/[OpenNauticalChart](http://opennauticalchart.org), and receive position over [NMEA0183](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183) (USB, Serial ports, etc) and [NMEA2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_2000) (ethernet, USB, Serial ports, etc). Primary focus for NMEA will be to support GPS positioning, but more devices will be added after a working version have been achieved.

I will also work with encrypted ENC, weather display from grib files, display of GeoTIFF and position calibrated images (of scanned charts), AIS and Radar overlays, displaying of tracks, tide and current information from HARMINICS, displaying information from multiple types of equipment, and filtering of corrected/uncorrected position data from multiple sources, such as GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, Loran C, etc.
